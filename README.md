# About 
Here are some basic examples of using library OpenCV v4.0.0 writen in Visual Studio 2017. These examples were done while I was preparing my exam and project from the subject [Machine vision](http://tnt.etf.rs/~mv/) on master studies, Department of Electronics, School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade.

# Installation & settings
You need the following :
1. Software: **Microsoft Visual Studio 2017**
2. Library: **opencv-4.0.0**
3. Environment Variable: **OPENCV_DIR**
